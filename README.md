# Q&A Tool

This simple application serves a server-rendered React application to the client. The application is made up of only a single component, but has full interactivity. It displays data fetched from fake db. The data are some IT related questions which you can upvote for.

Things that I cover in this project includes:

- Server rendering workflow 
- Create scaffold with Webpack and Babel
- Build client application using React and add interactivity
- Render the application on the server using Express.

I haven't add any styling here because my focus was mainly on the server-side rendering.

Project is set up without using of create-react-app and I done all the setup by myself.
